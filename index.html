            <h3>The Life and Legacy of Nelson Mandela: 1918-2013</h3>

            <header id="date">July 18, 1918</header><h3>Mandela Is Born</h3>
            Rolihlahla Mandela is born in <strong>Mvezo</strong>, a tiny village in the Transkei, a former British protectorate in the south. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a chief of the Thembu people, a subdivision of the Xhosa nation. The new child’s given name translates, colloquially, as troublemaker. He receives his more familiar English name, Nelson, from a teacher at age <b>7</b>.

            In the midst of Mr. Mandela’s trial on treason charges, he marries Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela, 16 years his junior. The tumultuous union will produce two daughters and a national drama of forced separation, devotion, remorse and acrimony.

            Mr. Mandela is hospitalized for nearly 19 days, being treated for pneumonia and having an operation for gallstones, government officials say. He will be hospitalized several times in 2013, as an increasingly <b>ugly battle over his legacy and money erupts</b>. <br>Even the African National Congress, the party to which Mr. Mandela dedicated his life, will come under harsh criticism for <strong>releasing a video of party leaders</strong> visiting the visibly ailing former president. <br>Mr. Mandela contracted tuberculosis during his 27-year imprisonment for fighting apartheid, and he has suffered from chronic lung problems.

            The government announces that Mr. Mandela has died, leaving the nation without its moral center at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the country’s leaders. <br>“<b>Our nation has lost its greatest son</b>,” President Jacob Zuma said in a televised address late Thursday night, adding that Mr. Mandela had died at <strong>8:50 p.m.</strong> local time.
